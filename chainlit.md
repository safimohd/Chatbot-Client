This project is a Chainlit-based conversational AI assistant designed for an e-commerce platform.
The assistant can naturally handle user queries like:

“Where is my order #12345?”

“Can I return my shoes?”

“Is the iPhone 15 in stock?”

“What is your refund policy?”

The app uses OpenAI’s GPT model to dynamically generate realistic, human-like responses.
No static rules or utility functions are used — the model creates mocked but believable data on its own (e.g., generating delivery dates, order numbers, and product details).
